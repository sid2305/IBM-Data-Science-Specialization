Hi guys! My name is Siddhant. I am a software developer at IBM Watson Health. I have done some minor projects on machine learning and recommender systems before. I am fascinated by the applications of data science and hence here I am to be a part of this data-centric era.

Data Science is a process of using data to understand different things in the world. It is the sexiest job in the 21st century.

Data scientist is someone who finds solutions to problems by analyzing data using the appropriate tools and then tells stories to communicate their finding to the relevant stakeholders.

I am passionate about the healthcare Industry and also fascinated by fintech.
